//! Checks the system clipboard for Paste off the UI thread. `has()` can block for seconds when the
//! clipboard owner never answers (an unresponsive X11 client), so it must not run on the thread that
//! draws the window: a worker owns a second clipboard handle, sends its verdict when it changes, and
//! the UI only reads the latest one. Without a worker the check stays in line, as before (the web,
//! and hosts that don't install a factory).
